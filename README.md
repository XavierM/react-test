# react-test
The project tests react components with Jest and Enzyme. The Jest tests are in "__tests__" folder. The Enzyme tests are in "test" folder. For enzyme, Mocha is used as the test runner and Expect is used as the assertion framework. A sample web application is built using Webpack.
* npm start - run web application at http://localhost:8080
* npm run jest or jest - run jest tests.
* npm run mocha - run enzyme tests.

Four test suites which compares:
* Basic Hello world testing.
* Testing structure.
* Testing behaviour.
* Testing component interactions.

The [CodeMentor tutorial] (https://www.codementor.io/react/tutorial/unit-testing-react-components-jest-or-enzyme) walks through the project in more detail.
